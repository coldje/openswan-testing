Basic pluto test using IPv6 subnets over ipv4 gateways (and NETKEY):

"westnet-eastnet": 2001:db8:0:1::/64===192.1.2.45[@west]...192.1.2.23[@east]===2001:db8:0:2::/64

1) west XXXXXXX ping6's east-in/east-eth0/east XXXXXXX on eastnet XXXXXX/XX
2) west adds an iptable rule to block plaintext from eastnet
3) west pings XXXXXXXXX again, but pong should be dropped by rule
4) west initiates connection "westnet-eastnet"; east XXXXXXX responds
5) netjig sends ping packets from westnet to eastnet
