Basic pluto with IKEv2 on the initiator (west), and on the responder.
It uses certificates, and it includes a configuration that will work
on racoon2.

This also tests having public keys loaded from certificates, but not
use the DN as the ID.  Pluto also loads the public key in the certificate
file with the name given.
